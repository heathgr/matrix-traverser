# Running matrixTraversalSolver Locally

Google Cloud functions can be run locally using the Cloud Function Emulator.  To do this, follow these steps:

- If the emulator is not installed, run `npm install -g @google-cloud/functions-emulator`.
- Make sure the emulator is running by using the following command `functions start`.
- Make sure matrixTraversalSolver is deployed to the emulator by running `npm run deployLocal`.

# Testing

Like many JS/Node projects, unit tests can be using this command `npm test`.

# Depolying

To run a deploy use this command `npm run deploy`.
