# Matrix Traversal

The Matrix Traverser is a web app that solves an algorithmic problem.  A random matrix of numbers between 0 and 9 is generated.  The problem is solved by calculating the LONGEST path through the matrix that meets the following conditions:

1. The path cannot move to a cell in the matrix that it has already passed through.
2. The path can only move to a cell of equal or greater value than the previous cell in the path.

It is possible to have multiple valid solutions.

A new matrix can be generated by clicking on the '+' button at the bottom of the app.  To change the value of a cell, click on it and enter a number between 0 and 9.  Once a cell has been changed, a new solution (or set of solutions) will be calculated.
