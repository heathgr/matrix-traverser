# Matrix Traversal

The Matrix Traverser is a web app that solves an algorithmic problem.  A random matrix of numbers between 0 and 9 is generated.  The problem is solved by calculating the LONGEST path through the matrix that meets the following conditions:

1. The path cannot move to a cell in the matrix that it has already passed through.
2. The path can only move to a cell of equal or greater value than the previous cell in the path.

It is possible to have multiple valid solutions.

## Project Goals

I started this project because I thought it would be a good way to put my development skills to the test.  At its core, it deals with a complex problem. that can be difficult to compute efficiently.  Devising an algorithm that can solve the problem was a good way I could challenge myself.

Additionally, this project was a good opportunity to learn more about the following:

## Google Cloud Functions
 
 Google Cloud Functions are a "serverless" product from Google. 
 They are similar AWS Lamba functions.  I used this project as an opportunity to test out this new product from Google.

## Complex Data Visualization

I wanted to present the problem and its solutions in a clear and concise way.  I knew this would involve more than simple charts and graphs.  This project was a good way to experiment with dynamically generated SVGs and CSS animations.
